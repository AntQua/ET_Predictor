# 🛸 UFO_predictor 👽

Welcome to **UFO_predictor** 🛸, an innovative and fun project developed during the LeWagon Lisbon data science bootcamp. Our tool allows users to predict and visualize UFO and alien visitations using advanced AI technologies.

## Project Overview

**UFO_predictor** 🛸 was pitched by me and as team leader developed the project in a team of 5. The primary goal is to predict potential UFO sightings in the USA and provide visual representations based on eyewitness accounts using cutting-edge machine learning and generative AI models.

## Features

- **UFO Sightings Prediction** 🌍: Predicts the location, shape, and duration of potential UFO sightings using machine learning models.
- **Generative AI Visualization** 🤖: Generates realistic images of UFOs and aliens based on the predicted data and user inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Models** 📊: Our models predict UFO sightings by analyzing historical data on sightings. We utilize models such as:
  - **Location Prediction Model** 📍: Uses clustering and regression techniques to predict potential sighting locations.
  - **Shape Prediction Model** 🔺: Employs classification algorithms to determine the probable shape of a UFO based on past reports.
  - **Duration Prediction Model** ⏳: Estimates the likely duration of a sighting using time-series analysis.

- **Generative AI Models** 🎨: 
  - We used a combination of GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) for UFO image generation 🛸 and OpenAI's DALL·E model to generate images of aliens 👽. The alien images are created by sending descriptive prompts to the OpenAI API, which returns a unique image based on the description. This approach provides a visual context to our predictions and adds an element of creativity and realism to the project.


## How to Use

You can explore our UFO Predictor app here: [UFO Predictor App](https://etpredictor-yipz5o2jvfznihk3dmcbru.streamlit.app/).

Simply enter the required data, and the app will provide predictions and visualizations based on the input. The user interface is intuitive and designed for easy navigation.
